# Sturctured-Streamin-with-Kafka-demo

This was a demo sort of thing, where I just copied the code (wrote the code while looking at orignal developer's code) which was reading a simulation of hear-beat data from Kafka Confluent and then dumping it in Databricks. And based on that data there was a PowerBI report which was showing the data changes in real-time.
